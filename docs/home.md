# Data is Complex, but Insights are Priceless

Welcome to my Streamlit site!

I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist with experience in both academic and business settings. 

My academic career was fuelling by technology and data science. Obtaining a Ph.D in Molecular and Structural Biology
where I generated structural models of proteins from X-ray diffraction data.

I also worked as a Post Doctoral Researcher for Cancer Research UK (CRUK) utilising Data Science of DNA sequencing
data to understand the complex genetic changes within Lung Cancer populations in response to chemotherapy. 

I have also worked within Industrial Science, developing non-invasive blood tests for expectant mothers to detect 
chromosomal abnormalities (such as Down Syndrome), utilising Machine Learning to assess the risk of an abnormality in 
the fetus.

Since transitioning into a Data Scientist of business, I have worked for clients helping them solve problems with 
data, from developing end-to-end ETL and feature engineering pipelines with model training and automated deployment, 
a multitude of predictive machine learning models, providing bespoke analytics and generally improving a businesses 
ability to make data-driven business decisions.

In my personal life I love competing n sports, I have been playing Roller Derby for the last decade, representing both
England and Manchester all over the world, (USA, Canada, Spain, Belgium & France). We have placed second in 3 World Cups
with England and pre-covid have been ranked 7th in the World with Manchester.

I also do CrossFit as well as Olympic weightlifting, cycling and rock climbing.

I am also an avid tinkerer, building electonics with my Rasperberry Pi's and over lockdown build a Arcade Cabinet.
