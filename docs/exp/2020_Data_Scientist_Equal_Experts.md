## Data Scientist - Equal Experts
##### 2020 - Present							
#### Predicting the resale price of used machinery
-	The client wanted to determine factors influencing the resale price of machines to better optimise sales prices.
-	Created a non-linear regression model to predict the price of an asset and how that price changes over time, which I deployed via a Flask API.
-	Conducted validation activities to build user-confidence in predictions as the industry was typically not data-driven.
-	Built a pricing index, modelling market trends over time, using regression to normalise sales to reference values.
-	The business is now able to sell assets faster and at a more appropriate price. They are also able to predict depreciation price on new assets and factor in price of selling assets in project costings.
#### Topic Modelling Call Centre Transcripts to Determine Common Conversations
-	The client wanted to surface common questions being asked in their call centre, to better serve customers.
-	Utilised the BERT tokenizer to embed the call transcripts then performed dimension reduction and clustering to identify common themes and topics in conversations between call centre staff and customers.
-	The business is now able to look at common questions, topics at different granularities and can surface this information to customers faster.
#### Demonstrating AI Potential in a Large Government Organisation:
-	Timeseries forecasting using 1D convolutional networks to analyse multivariate temporal data.
-	Using GANs and statistical modelling to create realistic synthetic data for use with testing data migrations.
-	Text classification using SpaCy and random forests for predictions and LIME to explain the predictions.
-	Built a graph database in GPU memory (cuGraph) of companyâ€™s house data to show a network of companies and their major controlling parties for querying.
