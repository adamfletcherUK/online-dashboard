# Data Science

-	Building end-to-end data pipelines handling: ETL, feature engineering, model training and API deployment.
-	Utilizing clustering to solve problems such as personalizing web services to predicting chemotherapy response
-	Topic modelling using BERT to cluster conversation transcripts, surfacing common questions and pain points.
-	Using regression models to accomplish tasks such as: predicting quality changes over time, calculating machine sales prices and normalising pricing data as part of a price index.
-	Created a question answering webapp utilising RoBERTa, where users could ask a question on a store of unstructured documents. Outputting an answer, contextual information, and a confidence score.
-	Generating accurate synthetic data using GANs (Keras) for testing data migration services requiring realistic data.
-	Promoting ML explainability using SHAP and LIME to enable end-users to determine why a prediction was made.
-	Timeseries forecasting using 1D convolutional networks and LOESS regression to predict future trends.
-	Created a multi-phase financial model for project costings, capable of predicting monthly pricings, initial debt, profit, and growth rate and how this is affected by payment terms for a project.
