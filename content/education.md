The major aim of my Ph.D thesis was to create a biological enzyme capable of
catalysing a useful carbon-carbon bond forming reaction, called the
Baylis-Hillman reaction.

This reaction is industrially useful as the product has a carbon=carbon double
bond which is highly reactive and able to easily accept additional functional
groups.

The approach was to take an existing enzyme which catalysed the formation of
another (but similar) carbon-carbon bond forming reaction. In this case we chose
an aldolase, understand how it's structure relates to it's function, then mutate
it's structure to allow the binding and reaction of new substrates more
applicable to the Baylis-Hillman reaction.

#### Aldolases

The aldolase chosen was a Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) aldolase which
typically converts Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (a 6 carbon sugar)
into two 3-carbon sugars, however, can be made to form Fructose
1,6-bisphosphate. We chose not to use the more studied FBP aldolase, form rabbit
muscle, due to a number of factors including:

- Stability at high temperatures (which would limit it's application in
  industrial chemistry)
- high throughput synthesis and purification.

Instead we chose to use an FBP aldolase from a therophilic archaea *T.tenax*
which was stable at temperatures above boiling, and would be abdunantly
synthesised when expressed in *E. coli*

#### Approach

In order to experiment on the properties of this enzyme, I first needed to
characterise it's initial properties such as:

- Reaction kinetics
- Crystal structure (both with and without substrate molecules)
- Have a method to detect the newly synthesised molecules (2D NMR)

#### X-ray Crystallography

The major method to determine and characterise the aldolases was X-ray
crystallography. It was chosen as it typically the "gold standard"
in viewing structural information in most use-cases. It not only allows for
determination of the normal crystal structure, but you can also add substrates
to see how these bind, in what conformations and how these change over time in a
chemical reaction.

#### Major Findings

It was previously characterised that there is a catalytic lysine amino acid, to
which the substrate molecule covalently binds, and that removing this lysine
renders the catalytic activity of the enzyme dead.

Rather than change this amino acid, instead we looked to change amino acids
within the binding pocket of the enzyme. If you think of an enzyme as a 3D
structure, with a surface area, the binding pocket serves to make sure only the
desired molecule binds to the enzyme and in the correct orientation.

Alterations to the shape of the binding pocket should allow for new molecules to
bind allowing for new reaction products.

Altering one such amino acid did result in a binding of a new substrate required
for the Baylis-Hillman reaction and in a new orientation, combining the 2D NMR
reactions we were able to show all the new reaction products, and how they
interacted with the enzyme.

#### Thesis Title

Characterisation of structural and biochemical properties of the *T. tenax*
and *S. carnosus* FBP Aldolases, investigating aldol condensation, enantiopurity
and the potential for catalysation of novel products.
