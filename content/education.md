## Molecular and Structural Biology	Ph.D

### University of Manchester     (2011 – 2016)

- Aiming to improve a chemical reaction by understanding the molecular interactions occurring and enhancing
  functionality.
- Developed and built 3D structural models of novel proteins and interrogated their chemical binding through
  experimentation and simulations.
- I was able to sufficiently alter the binding properties enough to change the target chemicals in the reaction
