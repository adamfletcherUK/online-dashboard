I've always loved Retro Games, I grew up playing the Sega Megadrive (Genesis), Gameboy and Playstation 1.

I've found though that as games are getting more and more complex that comes with certain drawbacks.

- They take an age to play if you need an update, this is annoying if you only have 20mins to spare
- The length of the games makes it much harder to just jump in and get going.

I LOVE modern video games, they can tell a full story with immersion far better than any retro-game can, but they also
demand a time investment I can't always give.

Since tinkering with both original hardware and emulators I have since found the original 80's and 90's arcade games,
a few of which I have played in Arcades - and fell in love again with them.

And over lockdown while in search of a project, I decided to jump into building retrogame platforms with both feet.

I have built Raspberry Pi's running retropie, built two player arcade control boards and have since built a full size
modern arcade machine with an old Gaming PC in it, it plays all orginal games and some modern ones too like Street 
Fighter 5, Cuphead and Overcooked.

I am currently looking to build a more social gaming setup where I can play with Lightgun games like House of the Dead 
and Time Crisis.
