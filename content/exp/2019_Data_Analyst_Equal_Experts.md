#### Creating needs-based personas for a job-listing service:
-	The client wanted to understand how users interacted with a job-listing website, aiming to personalise user experiences based upon their needs. 
-	As the survey dataset was incomplete, we used matrix-factorisation to predict user responses for unanswered questions, followed by clustering to group users with similar needs.
-	Clusters were used to make personas with user needs and the business was better able to respond to customers.
#### Modelling the cost of debt for delayed payment terms in commercial projects:
-	The client wanted to understand how the debt resulting from delayed payments terms affected the final profit of a project and company liquidity.
-	Using incoming and outgoing costs for each project, I created a multi-phase model for running projects, including the amount of debt accrued and how increased payment terms affected debt the cost of credit.
-	With this information, the client restructured their pricing system and was better able to forecast their liquidity at key times of the year. 
#### Reducing the cost of variation in providing a service:
-	The client wanted to restructure their national pricing model. But each franchise provided the same service with minor changes, resulting in differential cost to the business.
-	Working with a new workflow tracking system, we were able to attribute normal operating criteria and areas which were operating outside of them.
-	In a detailed report outlining standard operating procedures I also determined the cost-saving resulting from implementing the new procedures, which exceeded Â£2million.
