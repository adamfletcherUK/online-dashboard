### Using timeseries forecasting to determine manufacturing quality statistics:

- Developed a post-market surveillance system to establish and monitor quality
  metrics for the commercial products.
- Analysed metadata from internal and customer data to establish suitable
  quality thresholds for routine data monitoring and whether these were drifting
  over time.
- The outcome was the ability to forecast product quality drops and alert the
  support team for intervention.
