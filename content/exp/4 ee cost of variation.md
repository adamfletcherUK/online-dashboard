### Reducing the cost of variation in providing a service:
#### WIP

- The client wanted to restructure their national pricing model. But each
  franchise provided the same service with minor changes, resulting in
  differential cost to the business.
- Working with a new workflow tracking system, we were able to attribute normal
  operating criteria and areas which were operating outside of them.
- In a detailed report outlining standard operating procedures I also determined
  the cost-saving resulting from implementing the new procedures, which exceeded
  Â£2million.
