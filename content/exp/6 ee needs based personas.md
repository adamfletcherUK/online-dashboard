### Creating needs-based personas for a job-listing service:

- The client wanted to understand how users interacted with a job-listing
  website, aiming to personalise user experiences based upon their needs.
- As the survey dataset was incomplete, we used matrix-factorisation to predict
  user responses for unanswered questions, followed by clustering to group users
  with similar needs.
- Clusters were used to make personas with user needs and the business was
  better able to respond to customers.
