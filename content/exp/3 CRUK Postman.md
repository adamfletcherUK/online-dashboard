### Identifying markers leading to chemotherapy resistance in small cell lung cancer:
-	The aim was to develop a blood test, assessing and predicting patientsâ€™ response to chemotherapy.
-	Analysing multiple complex datasets to identify features driving drug-resistance, accounting for the large patient-specific genetic variations seen in biological datasets.
-	Processed genetic data and performed clustering to group pre-treated patients as drug-sensitive or resistant.
-	Utilising R to design data analysis pipelines for novel laboratory methods I have developed. 
-	The outcomes included determining drivers for chemotherapy resistance which could prolong the lives of patients.
