### Topic Modelling Call Centre Transcripts to Determine Common Conversations
#### WIP

The client had a large amount of call centre transcript 

- The client wanted to surface common questions being asked in their call
  centre, to better serve customers.
- Utilised the BERT tokenizer to embed the call transcripts then performed
  dimension reduction and clustering to identify common themes and topics in
  conversations between call centre staff and customers.
- The business is now able to look at common questions, topics at different
  granularities and can surface this information to customers faster.
