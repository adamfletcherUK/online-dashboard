### Modelling the cost of debt for delayed payment terms in commercial projects:

- The client wanted to understand how the debt resulting from delayed payments
  terms affected the final profit of a project and company liquidity.
- Using incoming and outgoing costs for each project, I created a multi-phase
  model for running projects, including the amount of debt accrued and how
  increased payment terms affected debt the cost of credit.
- With this information, the client restructured their pricing system and was
  better able to forecast their liquidity at key times of the year.
