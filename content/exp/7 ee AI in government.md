### Demonstrating AI Potential in a Large Government Organisation:
#### WIP

- Timeseries forecasting using 1D convolutional networks to analyse multivariate
  temporal data.
- Using GANs and statistical modelling to create realistic synthetic data for
  use with testing data migrations.
- Text classification using SpaCy and random forests for predictions and LIME to
  explain the predictions.
- Built a graph database in GPU memory (cuGraph) of companyâ€™s house data to show
  a network of companies and their major controlling parties for querying.
