## Personal

In my personal life, I love competing in sports, tinkering with electronics, and
am currently renovating a victorian house.

I play an odd sport, called Roller Derby, which is a full contact sport on
roller skates.

### Roller Derby

In my personal life I love competing in sports, I have been playing Roller Derby
for the last decade, representing both England and Manchester all over the
world, (USA, Canada, Spain, Belgium & France). We have placed second in 3 World
Cups with England and pre-covid have been ranked 7th in the World with
Manchester.

I also do CrossFit as well as Olympic weightlifting, cycling and rock climbing.

I am also an avid tinkerer, building electonics with my Rasperberry Pi's and
over lockdown build a Arcade Cabinet.
