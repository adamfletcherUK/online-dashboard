## Personal Life

I love competing in sports, tinkering with electronics, and am currently 
renovating a victorian house.

I play an odd sport, called Roller Derby, which is a full contact sport on
roller skates. I have represented both England and Manchester all over the
world, (USA, Canada, Spain, Belgium & France). We have placed second in 3 World
Cups with England and pre-covid have been ranked 7th in the World with
Manchester.

I am also an avid tinkerer, building electonics with my Rasperberry Pi's and
over lockdown build a Arcade Cabinet.

A fair number of weekends at present are now spent renovating a victorian house, 
complete with original tile floors, cornicing and a dilapidated outbuilding.
