## Data in Business

As a Data Scientist, I worked for multiple clients helping them solve problems 
and make better decisions with data.

I have a wealth of experience building predictive machine learning models, including
clustering, regression, classification, natural language processing an addition to 
utilising a plethora of advanced analytical and statstical approaches to gain insight 
from data.

I also have a large amount of experience serving machine learning applications to 
end-users either through deploying APIs or Dashboard and even building a full
end-to-end ETL, feature engineering and model training pipeline in a production 
setting.
