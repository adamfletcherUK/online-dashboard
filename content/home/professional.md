## Professional Experience

I have also worked within Industrial Science, developing non-invasive blood
tests for expectant mothers to detect chromosomal abnormalities (such as Down
Syndrome), utilising Machine Learning to assess the risk of an abnormality in
the fetus.

Since transitioning into a Data Scientist of business, I have worked for clients
helping them solve problems with data, from developing end-to-end ETL and
feature engineering pipelines with model training and automated deployment, a
multitude of predictive machine learning models, providing bespoke analytics and
generally improving a businesses ability to make data-driven business decisions.
