## Academic Experience

My academic career was fuelling by technology and data science. Obtaining a Ph.D
in Molecular and Structural Biology where I generated structural models of
proteins from X-ray diffraction data.

I also worked as a Post Doctoral Researcher for Cancer Research UK (CRUK)
utilising Data Science of DNA sequencing data to understand the complex genetic
changes within Lung Cancer populations in response to chemotherapy.
