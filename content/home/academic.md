## Scientific Career

My academic career was fuelling by technology and data science. Obtaining a Ph.D
in Molecular and Structural Biology where I generated structural models of
proteins from X-ray diffraction data.

I also worked as a Post Doctoral Researcher for Cancer Research UK (CRUK)
utilising Data Science of DNA sequencing data to understand the complex genetic
changes within Lung Cancer populations in response to chemotherapy. 

I have also worked within Industrial Science, developing non-invasive blood
tests for expectant mothers to detect chromosomal abnormalities (such as Down
Syndrome), utilising Machine Learning to assess the risk of an abnormality in
the fetus.
