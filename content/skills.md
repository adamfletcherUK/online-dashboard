# Key Skills

## WIP!! 

## Data Science

- Building end-to-end data pipelines handling: ETL, feature engineering, model
  training and API deployment.
- Utilizing clustering to solve problems such as personalizing web services to
  predicting chemotherapy response
- Topic modelling using BERT to cluster conversation transcripts, surfacing
  common questions and pain points.
- Using regression models to accomplish tasks such as: predicting quality
  changes over time, calculating machine sales prices and normalising pricing
  data as part of a price index.
- Created a question answering webapp utilising RoBERTa, where users could ask a
  question on a store of unstructured documents. Outputting an answer,
  contextual information, and a confidence score.
- Generating accurate synthetic data using GANs (Keras) for testing data
  migration services requiring realistic data.
- Promoting ML explainability using SHAP and LIME to enable end-users to
  determine why a prediction was made.
- Timeseries forecasting using 1D convolutional networks and LOESS regression to
  predict future trends.
- Created a multi-phase financial model for project costings, capable of
  predicting monthly pricings, initial debt, profit, and growth rate and how
  this is affected by payment terms for a project.

## Data Engineering

- Migrating Jupyter notebooks to production CI/CD data pipelines, complete with
  ETL, feature engineering, model training, deployment, and performance
  reporting.
- Deploying production ML APIs with multiple endpoints, serving model
  predictions for different purposes.
- Building simple data lakes on AWS and using AWS Glue crawlers to query
  multiple files and databases.
- Utilising frameworks like Dask and cuDF to parallelize and speed up computation time on large datasets.
- Experience using: Python, Jupyter, R, SQL, Shell, Tensorflow, Git, docker, Dask, Flask, Travis, AWS & Heroku.

## Communication

- Possess outstanding written and communication skills; disseminating technical information to board members, ensuring
  conclusions are comprehensible to technical and non-technical personnel.
- Extensive remote working experience as part of multinational teams or with no geographical location
