## Personal

In my personal life, I love competing in sports, tinkering with electronics, and
am currently renovating a victorian house.

I play an odd sport, called Roller Derby, which is a full contact sport on
roller skates.

### Roller Derby

I have been playing roller derby for over a decade, representing both England
and Manchester all over the world,
(USA, Canada, Spain, Belgium & France).

We have placed second in 3 World Cups with England And were ranked 7th in the
World (pre-covid) with the Manchester team.

The roller derby community in the UK and Europe is currently rebuilding after a
2-year hiatus from covid. So as of right now, there is no competitive scene - so
I am just doing it purely for fun.

### CrossFit

I am also an avid CrossFitter, doing a home session every lunchtime via Zoom.
It's currently either in my kitchen or outside (if it's sunny) - but there are
grand aspirations to have a home gym.

I am also a keen Olympic weightlifter (though am currently without a barbell),
cylist and rock climber.
