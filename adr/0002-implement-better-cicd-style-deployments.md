# 2. implement better cicd style deployments

Date: 2022-03-23

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The idea is to try and hone my general developer and data engineering style skills. Rather than just model building and
analysis.

## Decision

I will investigate "best practices" and implement them in this site - which can also be passed on to client projects.

## Consequences

It will become easier to test builds for the site and model etc. As well as expanding my knowledge of these areas.
